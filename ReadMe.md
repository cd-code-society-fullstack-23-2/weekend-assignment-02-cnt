## Java Programming Concepts Study Assignment


**Objective:** Enhance your comprehension of essential Java programming concepts by defining each term in your own words and showcasing its application through code.

**Instructions:**

1. **Research & Definition**
    - For each of the terms provided, articulate a definition in your own words.
    - Accompany the definition with a code snippet to exemplify its usage. Ensure your code is thoroughly commented, clarifying its significance to the respective term.

2. **Code Execution**
    - Ensure that all your code examples are syntactically accurate and can be executed without errors in a Java environment.

3. **Group Collaboration**
    - Form small groups of three members each. Collaborate within your group to discuss, refine, and finalize your definitions and code examples.
    - Though you're working in groups, be careful when considering borrowing someone else's code. You'll be individually responsible for understanding every piece of content you submit.

4. **Documentation & Submission**
    - Compile all responses into a Word document.
    - This document should be included in a designated repository along with all the code snippets.
    - Make sure your document and repository are well-organized, with each section and code snippet clearly labeled and commented.

5. **Presentation Preparation**
    - Be ready to RANDOMLY be selected on Monday to present your definitions and code examples to the class.
    - It's essential to thoroughly understand both your definitions and code since you will be questioned on every detail.

6. **Terms to Study & Demonstrate:**

    - Interface
    - Abstract Class
    - Polymorphism
    - Comparator
    - Enum
    - List
    - Unit Test
    - Overloading
    - Overriding

**Note on Academic Integrity:** While collaboration is encouraged, directly copying someone else's work without understanding is discouraged. Remember, understanding the concept is more valuable than simply having the correct answer.

**Due Date:** Monday
